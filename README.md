# SpringMvcRandomLuckInterceptor
MVC project to learn about concepts of "Interceptor", "user-defined-Exception-handling in Spring" &amp; related configurations in the Maven project.  
Try your Luck to pass the preHandle-Interceptor. 
if passed -> continue to welcome Page, 
if not passed will throw "BadLuckException" and spring will show the custonException page based on exceptions.  

Thanks...
